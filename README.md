## Overview

More and more customers are requesting integrations of uipath platform to other platforms like GitLab and Circle CI and UiPath is not able to create native plugins for all of them.

This **unofficial** library of DevOps PowerShell scripts will support customers to facilitate the interaction with the offical UiPath CLI to integrate CI/CD into their workflows and allow them to package, deploy and run automations and tests.

## Prerequisite:

- The provisioned vm or agent should be a window machine
- Add a step in your CI/CD pipepline to download the descired scripts. (Download only the scripts you need, for example if you want to Pack an RPA project then download UiPathPack script)
Use the scripts below as one step in your pipeline and give at any name (e.g. "Preparing Environment")

It is recommended to download copy of the scripts from the [scripts folder](scripts) into your own repository 
 ```PowerShell
 #Create scripts folder under C drive. (you can change the directory path )
 New-Item -Path "C:\\" -ItemType "directory" -Name "scripts";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathPack.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathPack.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathDeploy.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathDeploy.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathJobRun.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathJobRun.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathRunTest.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathRunTest.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathManageAssets.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathManageAssets.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathAnalyzeProject.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathAnalyzeProject.ps1";
 Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/UiPath-Services/UiPath-DevOps-Scripts/raw/main/scripts/UiPathCLIGeneric.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\scripts\\UiPathCLIGeneric.ps1";
```

<b><a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't create directory outside your CI/CD privisioned machine?</a></b>  
</summary>
Some CI/CD tool, like gitlab, may not allow the creation of folder outside the build/working directory . For this you need to place the folder and scripts inside the working directory. In the above script you will need to replace "C:\\" with the the CI/CD tool variable referencing the working directory. <br />
 for example, <br />
 GitLab <b>$env:CI_PROJECT_DIR</b><br />
 GitHub Actions: <b>${{github.workspace}}</b><br />
 ..etc<br />
